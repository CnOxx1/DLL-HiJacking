360 antivirus is a free cloud security antivirus software produced by 360 security center. It innovatively integrates five leading killing engines, including BitDefender virus killing engine, Avira virus killing engine, 360 cloud killing engine, 360 active defense engine and 360 second generation QVM artificial intelligence engine.

But as you can see, 360 antivirus can still do DLL hijacking. If there is an active defense process in the target process, then we need some other methods to operate DLL in the target file!
